                            <p>MyFitnessPal (MFP) is a workout and calorie-tracking app. It allows users to input their workout routines. Users can also
                                log their food intake and calculate their macros for weight loss or gain.
            
                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p>Users need a quicker, accessible way to view, log, and track their workouts and food log.</p>

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>Redesign MyFitnessPal's entire UI to improve functionality for users.</p>

                            <p>In MFP's v. 29.5.0 (March 2020), the current user interface is unappealing and difficult to
                                navigate. The home page is cluttered, and the blog picture doesn't show up (on the right).
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="UB">Interviews</h3>
                            <p>11 of my friends, who in age range from their 20's to early 30's. 5 of them were first-time
                                users. The others were familiar with or have used the app before.
                                <br><br>
                                I asked users:
                                <br>
                                - What do they use MFP for?<br>
                                - Why do they use MFP over other ones (if this is their preferred fitness app)?<br>
                                - What did they dis/like about MFP?<br>
                                - What is their most/least used feature(s)?<br>
                                - What feature(s) did they find difficult to use?

                                <br><br>
                                All of the users said they used it to log food to track their calorie-intake. About half used it to look further
                                into their calories, such as tracking macros by protein, fats, and carbs. Otherwise, they rarely used it to log
                                workouts. This can be influenced by a UI that isn't appealing.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <p>MFP offers features, such as changing food/water/weight units, that other fitness apps consider 
                                a “Premium” feature. For example, MFP allows you to change units, whether it's for water, food, or weight.
                                Other fitness apps require a subscription to continue using their app beyond a trial period (Calory, Noom, Carb Manager).
                                MFP also ranks the highest for usability and the most matches with USDA in their food database.

                                them. I had alternate versions of the landing page with various palettes of colors.

                            <h3>Landing page, Logging Food pages</h3>
                            <p>I made the design to allow quick informational access to the user’s calories, macros, and data all 
                                in one place. These places are the home page for summarized data, and the log food page for in-depth 
                                dietary data. Research shows that visible goals helps users to stick with them long-term.
                                Reinforcement and gamification in fitness apps aren't ideal either; instead, it offers as a distraction. 
                                Thus, I decided to not include certain design aspects for the redesign, such as including a progress bar that fills 
                                up when calorie goals are added and achieved. The visibility of goals increased the user's time exercising, intensity, 
                                and the diversity of their workouts.
                                <br><br>
                                Overall, the main goal was to redesign it to make certain features look better and have easier accessibility, but to not take
                                away from the fact that it is an app used to track calories.
                            </p>

                            <p>I liked the interface that MFP already had for the item's details, so I kept it as it originally is
                                from the app. I implemented it into the Log Food function while adding my own twist: an Add and Return
                                button.

                            <p>A challenge I tried to do was making it colorblind-accessible, but the amount of colors I used were a wide palette; I tried 
                                to make the design high-contrast instead. I struggled to define some icons, such as the scan or copy 
                                function in Log Food.
                            </p>
    
                            <h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
                            <p>I would add a Remove Food function, and the missed timestamp (dd/mm/yyyy) dates for food logs!
                                Putting text under some icons (Scan and Copy) so they're clear would have been another improvement 
                                as well.
