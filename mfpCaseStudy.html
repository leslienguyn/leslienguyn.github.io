        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a college student, working out seems almost necessary when you're 
            constantly going out with friends or balancing extracurricular activities. To me, at least, working out is
            a big part of my daily lifestyle to be healthy from all that food, to relieve stress, and 
            to look good. </p>
        <p>MyFitnessPal is a fitness app that I use daily to track my calories for my gym life. As of 2019,
            it has over 50,000,000 downloads for it in the range of 325,000 total fitness apps available on
            mobile<sup>1</sup>.
            However, I've noticed that it has a cluttered and difficult-to-use interface. The main function isn't
            on the landing home page; it's filled with many blog posts and workout videos, and there's 
            awkward grey spaces in between. For someone who wants to see quick data about their calories,
            the current design isn't as ideal.

        <p class="mfpCurrentCaption">Current MyFitnessPal interface March 2020, v. 29.5.0. The home page
        blog image doesn't even show up!</p>
        
        
        <br>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Before I could redesign, I asked myself what I was trying to solve. The interface wasn't
        appealing, but how could I change it while keeping what MyFitnessPal was actually for? That lead
        to the question: what (and who) is MyFitnessPal for? I gathered some data after reaching out to 
        some friends about the app.
        <img src="MFP%20Case%20Study.jpg" img class="infographic" alt="An infographic with data">
        </p>
        <p>I asked 11 of my friends, who range between early 20's to early 30's:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>What they use MFP for </li>
            <li>Why they use MFP over other ones (if this is their preferred fitness app)</li>
            <li>What they dis/liked about MFP</li>
            <li>What is their most/least used feature(s)?</li>
            <li>What feature(s) they found difficult to use</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In my research, everyone had the same idea and recognition of what MyFitnessPal
        is: a fitness app to track your calories. They all did mention that the interface was difficult
        to navigate, especially if you are first-time user. First-time friends mentioned this struggle before 
        familiarizing themselves.
        Moreover, 6 out of 11 people noted that they used the macronutrients breakdown feature to see
        details about their calories. Some liked that it had a food database to choose from, could scan food
        labels, and change water units. Most expressed negativity about the current interface, saying it
        is "unwelcoming" and it looks "too mechanical." About 9 out of 11 do not interact with the blog posts
        or exercise function. I realized I do not use any of these, either.

        <img src="review2.jpg" img class="review2" alt="review about myfitnesspal from the app store"> 
        <p>In addition to my research, I read up on scholarly research articles about fitness apps. I wanted
        to see if specific designing influenced actual fitness progress. As it turns out, reinforcement and
        gamification in fitness apps aren't ideal; instead, it offers as a distraction<sup>2</sup>. Users
        may be less likely to stick with their goals. Thus, I decided to not include certain design aspects
        for the redesign, such as including a progress bar that fills up when calorie goals are 
        added and reached. 
        Being able to see the user's goals also helped the user to stick with and reach their goals. The
        visibility of goals increased the user's time exercising. The intensity and diversity of their workouts
        increased, as well <sup>3</sup>. </p>
        <p><b>So what makes MyFitnessPal different from other fitness apps?</b></p>
        <p>It certainly offers a lot of features that other apps would consider "Premium." Other fitness or
        calorie-tracking apps, such as Calory, MyPlate Calorie Counter, Carb Manager: Keto Diet App, and
        Noom, all require some type of subscription in order to access important features that MFP
        otherwise would offer for free. For example, both Noom and Calory require a subscription to even use its' app.
        MFP also allows you to change units, whether it's for water, food, or weight. Other apps don't really
        offer what seems like this basic change, such as Calory and Carb Manager. MyFitnessPal also ranks the
        highest for usability and the most matches with USDA in their food database<sup>4</sup>.

        <br>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>I knew based off survey and statistical research data that it needed to include features that
        people liked, such as seeing their data quickly. As much as seeing it, accessing it quickly
        and easily was important. Overall, the main goal was to redesign it to make certain features
        look better and have easier accessibility, but to not take away from the fact that it is an app
        used to track calories.</p>

        <img src="draw2.JPG" img class="drawings2" alt="Leslie's sketches of the redesign">
        <p>I actually did not end up sticking to my drawings. I either kind of forgot about them (big mistake) 
        or decided I didn't like how it turned out when it actually came to prototyping it. There
        were other features that I wasn't able to get to, as well.</p>
        <img src="homepagesvariety.png" img class="homepageVariety" alt="Many versions of the redesign home page">
        <p>I struggled a lot with making the home page because I felt like that mattered the most with 
        first impressions, and I wanted users to continue using the app as long as it helped with 
        efficiency and usability. I tried to keep in mind color-blind users, but it was a little challenging
        given that MyFitnessPal's brand color has blue, so I tried to make the contrast high enough.
        Ultimately, I decided to go with this design (below). Once I got the home page down, it was 
        much easier to make the rest of the other pages.</p>
        
        <h3>Landing Page</h3>
        <img src="homepages.png" img class="mainThree" alt="Redesign of home pages">
        <p>I chose this design because it has everything you want to see quickly: your calories, macros,
        and your data at a glance on the home page. I kept in mind from the research that it was difficult
        to access goals, and seeing the user's goals would help the user stick with them long-term.</p>
        <img src="homegif.gif" img class="homeGif" alt="a GIF of the main landing page">
        <h3>Log Food Page</h3>
        <img src="logFoodImg.png" img class="logFood" alt="Log food pages prototype">
        <p>I made the mistake of leaving out the day/week/month date for accessing food logs. I tried to
        keep the same color scheme as the home page, but went with a slight gradient for aesthetic. Even
        after seeing it, I actually still don't really like the look of it, but don't know how to improve it.
        I also feel like I should have played around with more designs. I made multiple pages of the same design
        to see what it would look like had it been able to scroll. </p>
        <img src="resized.gif" img class="resizedGif" alt="a GIF of the home page clicking Log Food page">
        <p>I put a summary for calories and macros because it would be easy to see the detailed breakdown where
        you already log your food. The same idea was kept for Search, having Items and Recipes and Meals in
        one page. The page overall includes Recipes and Nutrients, which seem to be features that users 
        don't use often, but find helpful. I liked the interface and visual of the food item that MFP
        already has, so I incorporated it as a pop-up with an add and return button. 
        </p>

        <h3>Adding Food</h3>

        <img src="resized3.gif" img class="resized3Gif" alt="a GIF of returning back to Log Food page from Search page">
        <p>If I had more time, I would have added a Remove food function!</p>
        <br>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>For my first case study, this was actually really challenging. As a newly-transferred college
        student who also switched majors to UX/UI, I haven't gotten the chance to take a Design class yet.
        Nonetheless, this learning experience was fun! As for the redesign, I hoped to have checked off the
        requirements that I was looking for: tracking calories and other features in a quick, accessible way.
        Putting goals where people can actually see them will help users stick with them and encourage
        them to achieve them.
