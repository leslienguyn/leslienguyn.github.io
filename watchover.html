                            <p>Watch Over is a website for users to stream movies and TV shows simultaenously with other people.
                                Users can chat with their friends while watching, schedule watch parties, and have easy access to shortcuts. 
                                <br>
                                This was a submission for Adobe's Creative Jam with Netflix.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>We brainstormed that while streaming services had great sources, they all had unique, individual
                                features that weren't included in the one or the other. We created Watch Over to incorporate the best of both worlds
                                in addition to more functions. The name was inspired by the idea of having sleep overs, but instead
                                people are watching virtually, hence Watch Over.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Who</h3>
                            <p>I worked on this project with:
                                <br>
                                Grace Gao
                                <br>
                                Evelynne Lee
                            </p>

                            <h3>When</h3>
                            <p>The hackathon took place from June 22 - 26, 2020. I continued to work on this project and finish up all the 
                                details past the end date, and officially finished in early July.
                            </p>

                            <h3>How</h3>
                            <p>Adobe XD</p>

                            <h3 class="UB">What</h3>
                            <p>We looked at Disney+, Netflix, and Hulu. We came to the conclusion that Netflix had the best UI, but
                                didn't have the same variety as Hulu offered. Hulu had more services, but was not as accessible nor 
                                did it have previews like Netflix. Disney+ had images that took up the entire screen, and required
                                scrolling down before the user could see the options. 
                                <br>
                                We also looked at Spotify, and determined that we liked how it shows other friends' activities.
                                Inspired by the design, we incorporated a similar idea into our design.
                            </p>

                            <h3>How</h3>
                            <p>We took notes on what features we liked and disliked for each streaming platform. From there,
                                we narrowed down what the most significant features were to include for our website.

                            <p>We made mid-fidelity wireframes on Figma.</p>

                            <p>For the final design, I began to transfer it onto Adobe XD as we neared the end of wireframing.
                                I finished up the rest of the design after the Hackathon was done. I inserted all the media 
                                images, designed Dark Mode and the hover ratings expansion, and assisted with adding the text 
                                for Calendar/List/Favorites feature. I cleaned up and refined any small details to polish up the
                                visual design. I implemented all the prototype interactions throughout the project and at the end.

                            <p>It was challenging to incorporate the Favorites/Calendar/List feature since we didn't want
                                it to be distracting for the user, but accessible enough where they could find what they need.
                                Making the chat bubbles required some adjusting to a middle-ground since different screens will
                                always have different colors. 
                                <br>
                                In the future, it would be worth looking into the social aspect, such as something similar to
                                a Twitter timeline where people can talk about the movies or shows they're into. It could also
                                try connecting to different streaming platforms, or having adjustable layouts that the user
                                likes best.
