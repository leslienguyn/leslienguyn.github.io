                            <p>Pocket Trip is a travel app that allows users to book their travel plans and manage their 
                                itineraries all in one place at any time through their smartphone. </p>

                            <h3>Who</h3>
                            <p>This audience this app is aimed towards are for people who travel for work,
                                vacation, school, or are looking for temporary alternative housing or transportation.
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>Going back and forth from my hometown in the Bay Area to school in San Diego, I found that my family 
                                has trouble keeping track of all their itineraries. After talking to my peers, it turns out they're 
                                always the one in charge of booking these trips because their families have the same problem.</p>

                            <h3>How</h3>

                            <h3 class="UB">When</h3>
                            <p>The research period took 1.5 weeks. The card sorting took 2 days. Interviews took a total of
                                3 days, averaging 30 minutes each.
                            </p>

                           <h3>How</h3>
                            <p>I made three categories for fifteen cards that I planned to include for the app. I had 5 users
                                participate in organizing these cards into what they think best fits the category on UXTweak.
                                While it was hybrid sorting, no participant made new categories.
                            </p>
                            <p>I ended up making some features more flexible in multiple categories rathering than restricting 
                                it to just one. These features, such as the QR/numerical code, were redesigned later on to have 
                                less significance during the process to reduce confusion.
                            </p>

                            <p>For the interviews, I asked 10 acquaintances and friends to participate in answering 3 pre- and post-task
                                questions along with a user flow task. This was to measure if a user could get through the flow of 
                                the app without any trouble. These tests were performed on Quant, which allowed me to view heat
                                maps of where users were clicking. 
                            </p>

                            <img src="/PTimg/usabilitytestRG.png" class="usabilityTest" alt="summary of usability testing">

                            <p>From the tasks, 7/10 users seemed to misinterpret the directions. After watching the screen recordings
                                7/10 users tried to immediately book a flight instead of comparing listings. The heatmap also showed 
                                that users expected certain icons to work associated with the certain words, i.e. users clicking the edit 
                                icon button when asked to "edit details of trip."
                            </p>

                            <p>The post interview asked about the users' experience. While 7/10 said the process was intuitive,
                                some suggested that there should be a drop down list of options while typing their desired location,
                                notifications for price drops, and making the entire listing clickable instead of "see more."
                                I implemented these suggestions into my design after.
                            </p>

                            <p>I made low-fidelity wireframes on Quant. While these were used in user testing, these became rough blueprints
                                of making the final design. I referred to these for general placements.

                            <p>For the final design, I made high-fidelity designs on Adobe XD. I experimented with various designs before
                                choosing final ones.

                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>I also kept in mind of colorblind and people who may find it hard to see by adding 
                                in underlines, which was also a suggestion made during the research process. One user suggested
                                that "sign up should be first, or simply remove sign up altogether." I decided to get rid of
                                the entire process since it allows users to keep track without needing an account, but kept the option
                                and minimized it in case users wanted to sign up for faster check-out with saved information.
                                I made wallet-like confirmation cards for iOS users to add to their Wallet book.

                            <h3 class="UB">What</h3>
                            <p>The challenge for this app was figuring out logistics and the organization of the listings. Originally,
                                I had thought that there would be less steps and options for booking travel plans, but after conducting
                                research, a common and popular response related towards low prices. It challenged me to think about the
                                possible options that would center around having low prices as the main drive for booking travel plans
                                while making it easy, accessible, and visually appealing for the user to keep track of.
                            </p>

                            <h3>How</h3>
                            <p>The next steps would be implementing multiple selections for flight listings instead of one.
                                Allowing users to register their place as rentals (similar to Airbnb) would be another feature
                                that could expand the options for this app in a business-oriented way. Improving the flow 
                                and logistics for this app is another step that would be interesting to look at.
