                    <h3>What</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Modern Meliora is a small business that sells botanical watercolor prints on her Etsy! This freelance project focused on setting up a
                        Squarespace website to showcase her portfolio and shop.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Modern Meliora needs a way to expand their business platforms that lets users view and purchase Modern Meliora's work
                        in a centered spot.
                        <br><br>
                        Client's problem statement:
                        <br>
                        "I want to increase my online presence by establishing a website to showcase my work and increase my passive income."

                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>By using Squarespace, given that it is the most beginner user-friendly CMS website, we will work together closely to bring
                        her desired website to life using UX methods and research to make her stand out among similar competitors that also use
                        Squarespace. The value it would bring to Modern Meliora and her customers is a community to build a relationship with these
                        artists and bond over their interest in botanical watercolors.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Why</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>As Modern Meliora already has an Etsy shop online; it would be helpful to create a website that also shows her previous
                        work that was already sold and is no longer displayed on her shop. With a website, customers can find her information
                        beyond Etsy and view past or new watercolor designs. SEO will also help to increase online presence.

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>While Modern Meliora gave me inspiration for the website, I also used them as an opportunity to compare what their website offered.
                        Two popular botanical watercolorists, Anna Mason and Shealeen Louise, both had unique features on their websites. I also decided
                        to look at another general watercolorist, David J. Rogers, to see what made their website different from botanist artists.
                        <img src="/MM/MM_Miro.png" class="MM_Miro" alt="Blue, orange, and pink sticky notes separated into three categories (left to right): Homepage, Portfolio/Shop, Customer Engagement">
                        After combing through all three artists' websites, I organized the most common and unique features into 3 main categories:
                        the home page, portfolio/shop, and what they did for customer engagement. Some of these features overlapped or appeared throughout
                        the website, which appears in the middle between two categories. There were two features that David J. Rogers had that the other
                        two did not: a search bar and FAQ assistant across the site. This would help users find what they would want to see compared
                        to pre-set tags for a filter.
                        <br><br>
                        The most notable findings were that all artists had a section where they either separated their original artwork from other prints,
                        having featured or related products on their homepage or prints details pages, newsletters, and class/workshop courses.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Sitemap</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Next, I created a generalized sitemap of what Modern Meliora's website would include. Since Modern Meliora's goal is to begin establishing
                        her online presence, she wanted to focus more on her portfolio and to keep it simple for now. However, I went the extra length and included
                        shop so that way it would be built on UX research and save her the trouble of setting it up herself in the future. I decided to not
                        separate paintings from original vs prints since she was confused herself on the difference, and allow users to access all paintings in
                        one area within the site.

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>After doing some research in Squarespace, there was a lack of communication that arose between choosing a template. I went ahead
                        and gave the client 3 templates to choose from. Ultimately, she went with Lusaka. I thought this was a nice, basic template she 
                        can maintain once the website was handed off. Additionally, I thought Modern Meliora could benefit from linking her artwork and shop
                        in one easily accessible section on the homepage. 
                        <img src="/MM/lusaka.gif" class="lusaka" alt="gif of Lusaka theme on Squarespace">
                        I created lo-fi wireframes for each page. The most challenging part was not having access to Squarespace, so I designed "blindly"
                        not knowing if Squarespace would have restrictions, such as certain hover states or column adjustments. I also went ahead
                        and did mobile wireframes.

                        <h3>Hi-fi wireframe</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>After doing multiple rounds of critique sessions and making sure Modern Meliora liked everything that she wanted over a few months, I found that
                            sometimes what the client wants is not always the "best" for the business. For instance, she wanted two serif fonts on the website;
                            I suggested that a serif font pairing with sans-serif would allow users to scan and read her website better.
                            <img src="/MM/About Me.jpg" class="abtBodoni" alt="Modern Meliora rough draft of About Me page with pink footer and serif fonts">
                            At this stage, I still did not have access to Squarespace, so it was still difficult for me to design accurately. The biggest obstacle
                            was once I had access to Squarespace, I had to go back to the designs to modify them to make sure features functioned how she wanted 
                            or if it was something Squarespace could not do. This affected consistency across the site.

                    <p>In essence, I had fun making a website for a small botanical watercolor business! I enjoyed helping someone establish their
                        brand. It was challenging given that Squarespace had some limitations, especially with custom CSS code and functionalities.
                        If I had more time, I would definitely dig deeper into Squarespace's analytics tool to measure what customers were engaging
                        the most with! It would be nice to measure KPI's to help the business grow based on user research and patterns. It would also
                        be interesting to see if I could implement a search bar or personal FAQ assistant similar to David J. Roger's website. As
                        Modern Meliora continues to bloom in the future, I'd love to revisit and work with her again to add things onto her website
                        that would benefit her customers to gain business loyalty.
