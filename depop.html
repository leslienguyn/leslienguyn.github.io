                            <p>Depop is a fashion app selling second-hand clothing items for less. For this redesign, my group and I
                                focused on highlighting the educational aspect of sustainability.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p>Clothing waste and ethical concerns regarding fast fashion has increasingly become a concern.
                                Environmentally-conscious consumers need a resource to find sustainable, affordable alternatives for fast fashion and 
                                reducing clothing waste.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>Educate users through a mission statement and lead users towards eco-friendly sellers and items.</p>

                            <h3 class="UB">Competitive Analysis</h3>
                            <p>A competitive analysis compared Depop to two other apps in the market. 4 rounds of user interviews were conducted
                                through each iterative design stage. From these user interviews, affinity mapping on Miro helped categorize major sustainability issues.
                                Looking further into these categories, Depop became the most notable app to redesign for environmental awareness due to
                                comments about its UI.

                                I made the storyboard for a user need with a potential real-life scenario. I thought
                                about what situations a user would run into realistically while using this app. As a first time user for Depop, at least to me,
                                I think it would be cool to use this in my college environment!
                                </p>

                                Panel 2: She finds that it is difficult to identify sustainable brands and clothing on the shopping apps that she uses.
                                Panel 3: She downloads the app from an ad from a shopping site she visited, and is able to see sustainable brands immediately on the home
                                        screen and identify sustainable items based on an icon.
                                Panel 4: Thanks to these signifiers and categories, Jackson was able to find cute clothes that are sustainable. ">

                           <h3 class="UB">Target User</h3>
                            <p>Using the data from user interviews and storyboard, a primary and secondary persona were created. These personas captured both the primary
                                and secondary research from the competitive analysis and interviews. To keep the scope of the project in focus,
                                these personas were used throughout the whole redesign process to ensure user needs and goals were achieved.

                            <p>I helped with making the lo-fi wireframes used for the first round of user testing on Figma.
                                Narrowing the scope down, the redesign focused on 4 main functions: sustainable sections on the Home page,
                                shopping presentation, Search function, and incorporating a new Source Scanner function related to sustainability.
                            </p>

                            <p>While we made an entire section dedicated to Depop’s Sustainability Mission Statement to educate users, I recognized this
                                was a trade-off when users mentioned the Source Scanner was inaccessible or too hidden. This also contradicted the Home page
                                where users could click to learn more about this Sustainability Mission Statement section. If I changed up the attention-grabbing
                                signifier, could users still find the Mission Statement and Source Scanner? These changes were made in the final prototype.
                                <br><br>
                            </p>

                            <p>Users repeatedly had different opinions about the Sustainability icon during each prototype iteration. One user
                                thought that “the leaf icon meant it was vegan.” This was the most challenging part because how could I make an icon stand
                                as a symbol for sustainability? 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Checkout</h3>
                            <p>Once again, the sustainable icon was changed because a user thought the item was recycable. New users in the second round of user interviews stated that the Source Scanner was too hidden.
                                Another user said that they would like to see more details about the material from the brand, so an external link signifier was added.
                                <br><br>
                                Within Source Scanner, one user said that they wanted to find more details about the clothing item’s materials. After designing the entire page,
                                I put an external link signifier icon and underlined the brand’s clothing item. I hoped that this external link would allow users to see if it was
                                produced ethically and what type of materials were used with a specific percentage.

                            <p>If I had more time, I would definitely work on the more ethical side of fashion production. Looking more into
                                databases and having more accurate eco-friendly options and materials for users to filter through would be beneficial
                                in educating users.
                                <br><br>
                                Ultimately, I learned that the challenge for this app was how to find a universal understanding through visual design. 
                                Multiple users had different understandings of what the recycle icons represented; seeing how users approach
                                "Learn More" signifiers or sections also made me think out of the box how to market those while keeping the functionality of the app.
                                With these new highlighted features, I would hope it would encourage other social media platforms to do the same.
                                With more awareness and access to affordable, sustainable secondhand clothing, it can help slow down climate change.
