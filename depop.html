                    <h3>What</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Depop is a fashion app selling second-hand clothing items for less. For this redesign, my group and I focused on highlighting
                        the educational aspect of sustainability.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Clothing waste and ethical concerns regarding fast fashion has increasingly become a developing issue. Environmentally-conscious consumers
                        need a resource to find sustainable, affordable alternatives for fast fashion and reducing clothing waste.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Educate users through a mission statement and lead users towards eco-friendly sellers and items.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Why</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>As climate change rapidly continues to develop with more issues every year, it is important to focus on reducing as much waste
                        as humans can. <a href="https://pirg.org/california/articles/the-fashion-industry-waste-is-drastically-contributing-to-climate-change/">Clothing waste contributes to 10% of the world's global carbon emission →.</a>
                        While it seems difficult to prevent it individually, mass awareness and shifting large audiences can help slow down the amount
                        of clothing waste in the fashion industry. With 26M+ users on Depop, that's 26M+ users conscious about clothing sustainability.

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>A competitive analysis compared Depop to two other apps in the market. 4 rounds of user interviews were conducted through each iterative
                        design stage. From these user interviews, affinity mapping on Miro helped categorize major sustainability issues. Looking further into
                        these categories, Depop became the most notable app to redesign for environmental awareness due to comments about its UI.

                         sustainable efforts, environmental apps, fashion apps">
                        I made the storyboard for a user need with a potential real-life scenario. I thought about what situations a user would run into
                        realistically while using this app. As a first time user for Depop, at least to me, I think it would be cool to use this in my college
                        environment!
                        <img src="/depop/storyboard.png" class="storyboard" alt="Storyboard (left to right top and bottom):

                        Square 4: [Image of phone with sustainable markers] Thanks to these signifiers and categories, Jackson was able to find cute clothes that are sustainable.">

                    <h3>Personas</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Using the data from user interviews and storyboard, a primary and secondary persona were created. These personas captured both the
                        primary and secondary research from the competitive analysis and interviews. To keep the scope of the project in focus, these personas
                        were used throughout the whole redesign process to ensure user needs and goals were achieved.

                    <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>I helped with making the lo-fi wireframes used for the first round of user testing on Figma. Narrowing the scope down, the redesign
                        focused on 4 main functions: sustainable sections on the Home page, shopping presentation, Search function, and incorporating a new
                        Source Scanner function related to sustainability.

                        <img src="/depop/low fidelity/sourcescannerLow.png" class="wireframe4" alt="Sustainability mission statement and Source Scanner mockup">
                        While we made an entire section dedicated to Depop’s Sustainability Mission Statement to educate users, I recognized this was a
                        trade-off when users mentioned the Source Scanner was inaccessible or too hidden. This also contradicted the Home page where users
                        could click to learn more about this Sustainability Mission Statement section. If I changed up the attention-grabbing signifier,
                        could users still find the Mission Statement and Source Scanner?

                    <h3>Sustainability icon</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Users repeatedly had different opinions about the Sustainability icon during each prototype iteration. A user mentioned that the white
                        background on the recycle symbol "was difficult to see against light-colored clothing." This was the most challenging part because how
                        could I make an icon stand as a symbol for sustainability? I browsed through various icons considering contrast and color before switching
                        to a green leaf icon.

                    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The mission statement was put at the very top of the Shop Sustainably section. This will be the first thing the user sees as it catches
                        their attention since there's also a CTA at the top. If users want to find out more about it, they can expand by clicking "View Full Mission."
                        That way, the entire mission statement isn't overwhelming on users and they could find more about it separately away from the shops. The
                        Source Scanner is also accessible in both areas: the banner and in the informational section.
                        <br><br>
                        I changed the icon from the recycling to the green leaf icon. It increased contrast and was more prominent on displaying what items were
                        sustainable.

                    <h3>Source Scanner</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Source Scanner changed "Ranking" to "Rating" because users are more familiar with the word when it comes to navigating fashion on a 
                        website or mobile app. I added in a link to the item from the original brand so the user can view additional materials and information
                        from the brand itself. 
                        <br><br>
                        We ran into some issues if we were to elaborate on the feature how we'd be able to input/track/pull all this information
                        from a database. How might we automatically detect what materials were made in this article of clothing? How might we fill in the missing gaps
                        where material is not transparent on the manufacturer's website? How might we decipher faded labels? These were things to consider as we
                        continued to develop our redesign for the future.

                <div class="text">
                    <p>If I had more time, I would definitely work on the more ethical side of fashion production. Looking more into databases and having more accurate
                        eco-friendly options and materials for users to filter through would be beneficial in educating users.
                        <br><br>
                        Ultimately, I learned that the challenge for this app was how to find a universal understanding through visual design. Multiple users had
                        different understandings of what the recycle icons represented; seeing how users approach "Learn More" signifiers or sections also made me think
                        out of the box how to market those while keeping the functionality of the app. With these new highlighted features, I would hope it would encourage
                        other social media platforms to do the same. With more awareness and access to affordable, sustainable secondhand clothing, it can help slow
                        down climate change.
