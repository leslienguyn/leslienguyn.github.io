                            <p>Depop is a fashion app selling second-hand clothing items for less. For this redesign, my group and I
                                focused on highlighting the educational aspect of sustainability.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Who</h3>
                            <p>Depop's audience ranges from shoppers who are looking for second-hand items and sellers who are looking
                                to get rid of their used clothing.
                                <br><br>

                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>Sustainable lifestyles can be expensive and inaccessible. Clothing waste and ethical concerns regarding
                                fast fashion has increasingly become a concern. To reduce clothing waste, this redesign focuses on
                                promoting and providing affordable, sustainable fashion.
                            </p>

                            <h3 class="UB">How</h3>
                            <p>A competitive analysis compared Depop to two other apps in the market. 4 rounds of user interviews were conducted
                                through each iterative design stage. From these user interviews, affinity mapping on Miro helped categorize major sustainability issues.
                                Looking further into these categories, Depop became the most notable app to redesign for environmental awareness.

                                <br>
                                I created a storyboard that would help bring out situations where Depop users might want sustainable options.</p>

                                Panel 1: Jackson is really particular about clothes that use sustainable material.
                                Panel 2: She finds that it is difficult to identify sustainable brands and clothing on the shopping apps that she uses.
                                Panel 3: She downloads the app from an ad from a shopping site she visited, and is able to see sustainable brands immediately on the home
                                        screen and identify sustainable items based on an icon.
                                Panel 4: Thanks to these signifiers and categories, Jackson was able to find cute clothes that are sustainable. ">

                            <h3 class="UB">Why</h3>
                            <p>Using the data from user interviews and storyboard, a primary and secondary persona were created. These personas captured both the primary
                                and secondary research from the competitive analysis and interviews. To keep the scope of the project in focus,
                                these personas were used throughout the whole redesign process to ensure user needs and goals were achieved.

                            <p>I helped with making the lo-fi wireframes used for the first round of user testing on Figma.
                                Narrowing the scope down, the redesign focused on emphasizing the sustainable sections on the Home page, shopping
                                presentation, Search function, and integrating a new Source Scanner.

                            <p>After conducting the first round of user interviews, 2/4 users said that the Learn More feature was too hidden. 
                                1 even said that the leaf icon made them think the item was vegan. For the high-fidelity prototypes, 
                                these changes were focused on to clear any confusion and to visually stand out.
                            </p>
                            <img src="/depop/homeHigh.png" class="homeHigh" alt="Home page high fidelity wireframe">

                            <img src="/depop/sourcescannerHigh.png" class="ssHigh" alt="Source Scanner page high fidelity wireframe">

                            <p>Once again, the sustainable icon was changed because a user thought the item was recycable. New users in the second round of user interviews stated that the Source Scanner was too hidden.
                                Another user said that they would like to see more details about the material from the brand, so an external link signifier was added. 
                                The final design incorporated all the feedback.</p>

                            <p>If I had more time, I would definitely work on the more ethical side of fashion production. Looking more into
                                databases and having more accurate eco-friendly options and materials for users to filter through would be beneficial
                                in educating users.
                                <br><br>
                                Ultimately, I learned that the challenge for this app was how to find a universal understanding through visual design. 
                                Multiple users had different understandings of what the recycle icons represented; seeing how users approach
                                "Learn More" signifiers or sections also made me think out of the box how to market those while keeping the functionality of the app.
