                            <p>Me.</p>
            
                            <h3>What tools were used to redesign?</h3>
                            <p>Adobe Photoshop</p>
                            <p>Figma</p>

                            <h3>Why redesign MyFitnessPal (MFP)?</h3>
                            <p>To track calories and fitness goals, and to improve the user interface that functions more
                                in an efficient way.
                            </p>
        
                            <h3>How long did the project take?</h3>
                            <p>A total of 5 days: 2 days for research, 3 days to design and prototype.</p>

                            <p>In MFP's v. 29.5.0 (March 2020), the user interface is unappealing and difficult to
                                navigate. The home page is cluttered, and the blog picture doesn't show up (on the right).

                            <h3 class="UB">Who was included in the research?</h3>
                            <p>11 of my friends, who in age range from their 20's to early 30's. 5 of them were first-time
                                users. The others were familiar with or have used the app before.
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>What did I ask them?</h3>
                            <p>- What do they use MFP for?</p>
                            <p>- Why do they use MFP over other ones (if this is their preferred fitness app)?</p>
                            <p>- What did they dis/like about MFP?</p>
                            <p>- What is their most/least used feature(s)?</p>

                            <h3>What makes MFP different from other apps?</h3>
                            <p>MFP offers features, such as changing food/water/weight units, that other fitness apps consider 
                                a “Premium” feature. For example, MFP allows you to change units, whether it's for water, food, or weight.
                                Other fitness apps require a subscription to continue using their app beyond a trial period (Calory, Noom, Carb Manager).
                                MFP also ranks the highest for usability and the most matches with USDA in their food database.

                            <p>I drew potential MFP layouts on paper, designed completely different visuals in Figma, and prototyped 
                                them. I ensembled the prototype simulation from Figma using Quicktime screen recorder on Mac. I made 
                                the gifs by importing the recorded screen videos in Gifski.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Landing page, Logging Food pages</h3>
                            <h3>How did I implement these improvements?</h3>
                            <p>I made the design to allow quick informational access to the user’s calories, macros, and data all 
                                in one place. These places are the home page for summarized data, and the log food page for in-depth 
                                dietary data. Research shows that visible goals helps users to stick with them long-term.
                                Reinforcement and gamification in fitness apps aren't ideal either; instead, it offers as a distraction. 
                                Thus, I decided to not include certain design aspects for the redesign, such as including a progress bar that fills 
                                up when calorie goals are added and achieved. The visibility of goals increased the user's time exercising, intensity, 
                                and the diversity of their workouts.
                                <br><br>
                                Overall, the main goal was to redesign it to make certain features look better and have easier accessibility, but to not take
                                away from the fact that it is an app used to track calories.
                            </p>

                            <p>I liked the interface that MFP already had for the item's details, so I kept it as it originally is
                                from the app. I implemented it into the Log Food function while adding my own twist: an Add and Return
                                button.

                            <p>I tried to make it colorblind-accessible, but the amount of colors I used were a wide palette; I tried 
                                to make the design high-contrast instead. I struggled to define some icons, such as the scan or copy 
                                function in Log Food.
                            </p>
    
                            <h3>What are the next steps?</h3>
                            <p>I would add a Remove Food function, and the missed timestamp (dd/mm/yyyy) dates for food logs!
                                Putting text under some icons (Scan and Copy) so they're clear would have been another improvement 
                                as well.
