                            <h3 class="UB">What</h3>
                            <p>Pocket Trip is a travel app that allows users to book their travel plans and manage their 
                                itineraries all in one place at any time through their smartphone. </p>

                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                            <p>Travelers need a quick, accessible planning and booking process in order to stay organized, which can reduce
                                stress and save money, while traveling.  
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>By making a platform that includes both planning and booking into one, Pocket Trip enables users to compare
                                prices, browse destination activities, and book flights, hotels, and other services in one app. The initerary
                                is stored in Pocket Trip, where the rest of the traveler's plans are!
                            </p>

                            <h3>Why</h3>
                            <p>My parents, who are immigrants, struggle to keep track of all travel itineraries. Because there are millions of travel-booking
                                websites out there in the world, it’s easy to get lost on what platform you booked a plan on. Considering how prices change
                                everyday and deals showing up on these various websites, it makes sense how you want to optimize your savings while sticking
                                with your original plan. As a result, I’m always the one keeping track of these itineraries. After searching for a way to
                                manage booking and planning in one, it seems that there are none to help keep track of everything. 
                            </p>

                            <h2>User Findings</h2>
                            <hr class="lineBottomResearch">

                            <h3 class="UB">When</h3>
                            <p>I made a sitemap of the user flow among general travel websites. I put myself in the users' shoes and pretended
                                to book a flight or hotel myself. This helped me think about what possible pain points or steps that can cause users to get
                                frustrated. How might we improve this process while reducing user clicks? How might we make it more simple and easier for users
                                to access information they need?
                                <br><br>
                                After performing a competitive analysis, I looked for certain features that would make users more likely to choose
                                a certain website over another. What features would discourage users from making that booked trip on the website?
                                I had a general idea of what Pocket Trip could include based off the competitive analysis.
                                <br><br>
                                More importantly, I wanted to know what features real travelers looked for and wanted.
                            </p>

                            <img src="/PTimg/competitorChart.png" class="competitor" alt="chart comparison of competitors">

                           <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                            <p>I conducted a card sorting test to see what features 5 users thought belonged to a certain travel category.
                                Using the sitemap, I put in general features and sorted it into 3 categories, but also added in some unique
                                features I thought would be helpful for Pocket Trip.
                                <br><br>
                                My findings were actually very surprising! While some features were more obvious, such as "Booking a Flight" matching with 
                                the "Plan a Trip" category, other features did not fall into the same categories across all users. For example, users thought that
                                "Save and compare listings" fell into "Manage Itineraries" AND "Plan a Trip." This made me realize that features shouldn't be
                                constricted to one category; instead, they should be flexible by being accessible in multiple categories. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Lo-fi Testing</h3>
                            <p>After making lo-fi wireframes, I conducted user testing among 10 users. I performed convenient sampling on my 10 friends,
                                and did a within-subjects testing through text and Quant to measure heatmaps. I first asked them how they felt about
                                the overall booking process and what features they focused on while browsing for travel plans.
                                <br><br>
                                A majority of the users actually focused on deals. This was surprising to me because I thought the process itself could
                                be improved, but users wanted to save money. One user even said that they felt "frustrated that the website showed 
                                lower prices after booking." 
                            </p>

                            <img src="/PTimg/usabilitytest.png" class="usabilityTest" alt="summary of usability testing">

                            <p>While users were performing the tasks, 7/10 were unable to perform all the tasks even though they confidently said they did.
                                After rewatching the heatmap recordings, it turns out users were confused about where to click and misinterpreted the directions.
                                I realized that this was my mistake; their actions may have been affected because I put the screens and directions "out of order."
                                I made users try to compare hotel listings before booking a flight. Typically, a user would book a flight before looking at hotels.
                                The conceptual model the user had overrode the directions, thus making them confused which caused them to click everywhere for an exit.
                                <br><br>
                                Users also wanted to see more system feedback. They didn't really know what was happening without system notifications or button responses.
                                <br><br>

                            <h3 class="UB">Design</h3>
                            <p>As a result, I switched the orders for the final design and prioritized putting Flight before Hotel. Users also mentioned that they would like
                                to see new airlines available to fly for the trip and a list of the best deals in town. Again, they all related to saving money for the trip.
                                Additionally, 7/10 users said the overall user flow was "intuitive."
                                <br><br>
                                My initial design plans actually changed. Still focusing on the problem statement, I ended up rearranging some buttons, changed the color, 
                                and refined naming conventions.
                            </p>

                            <p>For the Notify Price Drop feature, I tried to figure out the trade-off between underline or not to signify that it's clicked. However,
                                I decided against it since I figured that the clicked button color fill would benefit colorblind users as well in terms of contrast.
                                Underlined words may confuse other users thinking it would lead to an external link.

                            <p>Based on the user testing, I switched the Location and Date screens. To better match user flow and common system image
                                in travel websites, I put the Destination first, and then the Dates. I made wallet-like confirmation cards for iOS users to
                                add to their Wallet book.

                            <p>One user suggested that "sign up should be first, or simply remove sign up altogether." I decided to get rid of
                                the entire process since it allows users to keep track without needing an account, but kept the option
                                and minimized it in case users wanted to sign up for faster check-out with saved information. Of course,
                                I included the system feedback of letting the user know that their actions were confirmed.

                            <p>In the end, I learned that creating an app from scratch is not easy! Nonetheless, I also gained lots of insights
                                about the travel process and how much more it can be improved on. The challenge for this app was figuring out logistics
                                and the organization of the listings.
                                <br><br>
                                 Originally, I had thought that there would be less steps and options for booking travel plans, but after conducting
                                research, a common and popular response related towards low prices. It challenged me to think about the
                                possible options that would center around having low prices as the main drive for booking travel plans
                                while making it easy, accessible, and visually appealing for the user to keep track of.
                                <br><br>
                                The next steps would be implementing multiple selections for flight listings instead of one.
                                Allowing users to register their place as rentals (similar to Airbnb) would be another feature
                                that could expand the options for this app in a business-oriented way. Improving the flow 
                                and logistics for this app is another step that would be interesting to look at.
