                    <h3>What</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Pocket Trip is a mobile travel app that allows users to book their travel plans and manage their itineraries all in one
                        place at any time through their smartphone.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Travelers need a quick, accessible planning and booking process in order to stay organized which can reduce
                        stress, time, and save money while traveling.
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>By making a platform that includes both planning and booking into one, Pocket Trip enables users to compare prices,
                        browse destination activities, and book flights, hotels, and other services in one app. The initerary is stored in
                        Pocket Trip, where the rest of the traveler's plans are!
                    </p>
                    <br><br><br>
    
                    <h3>Why</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Everyday people travel for many different reasons: vacation, business trips, touring for a new home or school, education,
                        and more. Accessing your travel itinerary can get lost easily in a sea of emails or other life reminders. Not to mention
                        leaving for the airport can cause high stress since one wouldn’t want to forget anything; a travel itinerary would be the
                        last thing you would want to forget! Pocket Trip could help reduce the amount of time, stress, and cognitive load in the
                        mind so it can attend to other travel-related activities.

                    <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>I made a user flow journey sitemap among general travel websites. I put myself in the users' shoes and pretended to book a
                        flight or hotel myself. This helped me think about what possible pain points or steps that can cause users to get frustrated.
                        How might we improve this process while reducing user clicks? How might we make it more simple and easier for users to access
                        information they need?
                        <br><br>
                        After performing a competitive analysis among popular and less-known travel websites, I looked for certain features that would make
                        users more likely to choose a certain website over another. What features would discourage users from making that booked trip on the website?
                        This helped me create a general idea of what Pocket Trip could include based off the competitive analysis.
                        <br><br>
                        More importantly, I wanted to know what features real travelers looked for and wanted.

                    <br><br>
    
                    <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>Next, I conducted a card sorting test to see what features 5 users thought belonged to a certain travel category. Using the user flow journey sitemap,
                        I put in general features and sorted it into 3 categories, but also added in some unique features I thought would be helpful for Pocket Trip.
                        <img src="/Users/leslienguyen/Desktop/Projects/pocket trip/supporting images/cardSortSample.png" class="cardSort1" alt="Card sorting categories (left to right) with options: FAQ/Help, Manage Itineraries, Plan a Trip">
                        <img src="/Users/leslienguyen/Desktop/Projects/pocket trip/graphics:charts/cardsort.png" class="cardSort2" alt="Card Sorting testing + summary.
                        Card sorting task: 5 users were asked to perform a hybrid of open and closd card sorting task. I categorized them ahead of time into 3 groups.
                        The goal was to categorize features (cards) that they thought would fit the best category or make up their own.
                        
                        Results: 4/5 users categorized 10 cards into the 'correct' 3 categories the way I had in mind. When it came to 3 specific cards, commonality became
                        divided across the board.
                        
                        Analyzing the data: Based off the data, I decided to design according to the majority of how users interpreted the cards. If majority categorized a 
                        card elsewhere than I thought, I changed the design idea. FAQ/Help categorization may have implied the user was confused themselves, did not know where
                        the card belongs, or could also be an actual part of the category.">
                        My findings were actually very surprising! While some features were more obvious, such as "Booking a Flight" matching with the
                        "Plan a Trip" category, other features did not fall into the same categories across all users. For example, users thought that
                        "Save and compare listings" fell into "Manage Itineraries" AND "Plan a Trip." This made me realize that features shouldn't be
                        constricted to one category; instead, they should be flexible by being accessible in multiple categories.

                    <h3>Lo-Fi Testing</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>After making lo-fi wireframes, I conducted a pre- and post-test interview to gather data on how people book their travel plans and 
                        what shapes their experiences with it among 10 users. I performed convenient sampling on my 10 friends and did a within-subjects
                        testing through Quant to measure heatmaps. 
                        <br><br>
                        While users were performing the tasks, 7/10 were unable to perform all the tasks even though they confidently said they did. After
                        rewatching the heatmap recordings, it turns out users were confused about where to click and misinterpreted the directions. I realized
                        that this was my mistake; their actions may have been affected because I put the screens and directions "out of order." I made users
                        try to compare hotel listings before booking a flight. Typically, a user would book a flight before looking at hotels. The conceptual
                        model the user had overrode the directions, thus making them confused which caused them to click everywhere for an exit.

                        Text speech 1: It took me a while to figure out how to switch from default of two adults to just one so I could look at the right prices.
                        Text speech 2: I'm frustrated that the website showed lower prices after booking my flight!
                        Text speech 3: I don't want hidden fees to be hidden; I want to know what I'm paying for.
                        Text speech 4: I wish there was a low-fare calendar.">
                        As it turns out, majority of the users actually focused on deals. This was surprising to me because I thought the process itself could be improved,
                        but users wanted to save money. Users also wanted to see more system feedback. They didn't really know what was happening without
                        system notifications or button responses.

                    <br>
                    <p>As a result, I switched the orders for the final design and prioritized putting Flight before Hotel. Users also mentioned that they
                        would like to see new airlines available to fly for the trip and a list of the best deals in town. Again, they all related to saving
                        money for the trip. Additionally, 7/10 users said the overall user flow was "intuitive."
                        <br><br>
                        My initial design plans actually changed. Still focusing on the problem statement, I ended up rearranging some buttons, changed the color,
                        and refined naming conventions.

                        In the images below, I played around with the colors, placement of icons, and text fields before making the final decision.

                        For the Notify Price Drop feature, I tried to figure out the trade-off between underline or not to signify that it's clicked. However,
                        I decided against underlining since I figured that the clicked button color fill would benefit colorblind users as well as providing contrast.
                        Underlined words may confuse other users thinking it would lead to an external link.

                    <p>Based on the user testing, I switched the Location and Date screens. To better match user flow and common system image in travel websites,
                        I put the Destination first, and then the Dates. I made wallet-like confirmation cards for iOS users to add to their Wallet book.

                    <p>One user suggested that "sign up should be first, or simply remove sign up altogether." I decided to get rid of the entire process since
                        it allows users to keep track without needing an account, but kept the option and minimized it in case users wanted to sign up for faster
                        check-out with saved information. Of course, I included the system feedback of letting the user know that their actions were confirmed.

                    <p>In the end, I learned that creating an app from scratch is not easy! Nonetheless, I also gained lots of insights about the travel process
                        and how much more it can be improved on. The challenge for this app was figuring out logistics and the organization of the listings.
                        <br><br>
                        Originally, I had thought that there would be less steps and options for booking travel plans, but after conducting research, a common and
                        popular response related towards low prices. It challenged me to think about the possible options that would center around having low prices
                        as the main drive for booking travel plans while making it easy, accessible, and visually appealing for the user to keep track of.
                        <br><br>
                        The next steps would be implementing multiple selections for flight listings instead of one. Allowing users to register their place as
                        rentals (similar to Airbnb) would be another feature that could expand the options for this app in a business-oriented way. Improving the
                        flow and logistics for this app is another step that would be interesting to look at.
